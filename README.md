# Medical Image Analysis with CNN  
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images and detect pneumonia. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system classifies X-ray images as normal or pneumonia, aiding healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses.

## Dataset  

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)  

The dataset contains chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:  
- **Normal**  
- **Pneumonia**  

### Steps to Download the Dataset  

1. **Log in to Kaggle**:  
   - Create an account or log in to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  

2. **Navigate to the Dataset Page**:  
   - Go to the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) page.  

3. **Download the Dataset**:  
   - Click on the **Download** button to download the dataset as a `.zip` file.  

4. **Upload to Google Drive**:  
   - Extract the downloaded `.zip` file and upload the dataset folder (`chest_xray`) to your Google Drive.  

5. **Link Google Drive to Google Colab**:  
   - In the Colab notebook, mount your Google Drive using the following code snippet:  
     ```python  
     from google.colab import drive  
     drive.mount('/content/drive')  
     ```  
   - Navigate to the uploaded dataset folder in your Colab notebook.

## How to Use  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine or directly open the Colab notebook.  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-image-analysis-with-cnn.git  
   cd medical-image-analysis-with-cnn  
   ```  

2. **Open the Colab Notebook**:  
   - Navigate to the folder containing the Colab notebook (`medical_image_analysis_cnn.ipynb`) and open it in Google Colab.  

3. **Connect Google Drive**:  
   - Mount your Google Drive as described in the **Dataset** section.  

4. **Run the Notebook**:  
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to:  
     - Load and preprocess the dataset.  
     - Train the CNN model.  
     - Evaluate model performance.  
     - Visualize results.  

5. **Modify Parameters (Optional)**:  
   - The notebook allows you to tweak parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.

## Key Features  

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images.  
- **CNN Architecture**: A deep learning model optimized for binary classification.  
- **Visualization**: Plots loss and accuracy metrics during training, along with confusion matrices for evaluation.

## Results  

- The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.  
- Visualizations and predictions are displayed directly in the notebook for easy interpretation.  

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Expand the model to handle multi-class classification for other diseases.  
- Integrate explainable AI (e.g., Grad-CAM) to visualize regions of interest.  
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-world usage.
